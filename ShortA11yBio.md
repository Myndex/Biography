## BACKGROUND

Andrew has more than 35 years of professional media experience in the Hollywood film and television industry. As a recognized industry guru and technology evangelist, he’s worked with design, color, digital imaging, typography, lighting, cinematography, and visual effects.

Several years ago, Andrew’s eyesight became severely impaired due to early onset cataracts and related complications. Not to allow decades of color vision knowledge go to waste, he refocused his research toward visual accessibility. As an Invited Expert at W3C/WAI, he was research lead with the Visual Contrast group, and developed the APCA contrast method.
