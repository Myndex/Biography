# Andrew Somers Biography
A brief general overview, with discussion weighted toward film & digital technology.

## Early Years
Andrew Somers became interested in visual and performing arts & sciences at a very early age, **starting with photography at age 8** with his first Kodak Brownie camera in the early 1970s, and with a myriad of electronics kits and experiments. At age 10 his school placed him in an experimental **advanced program for gifted children** following exceptionally high testing _(California MGM)_. This advanced program focused on developing skills which are still useful as **a life-long learner**, and included afternoon classs at the near-by Westminster college once a week. By age 11 Andrew wrote, drew, and animated his first animated short, shot on Super-8 film.

In the mid 1970s, some years before the _IBM PC_, Andrew was **introduced to computer programming** via acoustical modem to the local college mainframe (working with line-numbered Fortran IV & BASIC). This was also the era of experimental electronic music, when Andrew had the opportunity to experiment with a MiniMoog. Andrew **realized the potentials for merging technology and art**, which became the underlying theme of his life's work.

### _Life Long Learning_
As a teenager, Andrew played a Miraphone in the local symphony orchestra, and worked in the layout/production department as Production Manager of his college newspaper—this was well before desktop publishing, when layouts were completed with razor blades and wax. At Western Washington University, Andrew became involved at the college radio station, getting his first broadcasting license in 1979. There he learned multi-track recording, and actively pursued performing arts, playing in Summer Stock, before entering professional broadcast radio, thanks to the guidance from his friend and classmate _Glenn Beck_.

## Broadcasting
For much of the 1980s, he worked in broadcast radio. Engaged not only for his skills in news gathering, writing & producing radio content, but also for his skills in broadcast engineering. This led to a **position as Chief Engineer** for an AM/FM combo in Southern California, and joining the **Society of Broadcast Engineers**. Subsequently, he moved into television when a local television station brought him on to work with the news department. Additionally, he found engineering work with a satellite up-link facility.

### _Move to Television_
But Andrew recognized that he needed greater creative challenges. While working on the post-production for a syndicated television program (GLOW), he was offered a **creative position in sound and music** for the show, and he jumped at the chance. This led to his first professional credits as a **Director of Photography** with the same production company. He has since developed a lengthy list of credits and awards, including **three Emmy awards**, two of which were as supervising sound designer for **"Beakman's World"** (CBS).

## Technology Evangelist
He was also sound effects supervisor & SFX mixer for **"Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"** (FOX), this show was among the **first to employ digital sound technology** for editing sound for picture, the Fairlight MFX2. Andrew was instrumental in evaluating the available systems and **developing the first digital workflows** for production use, on a show with a high workload and short deadlines. This was in the infancy of digital technology for film and TV, well before _ProTools_ was capable of the task. Andrew became a **technology evangelist for digital film tools**, particularly Fairlight, and this led to some significant feature-film credits, including **"Flubber"** _(he developed the sound of flubber itself)_, **"The Thin Red Line"**, **"The Matrix"**, **"Deep Impact"** and others.

### _The Future of the Past was Digital_
By the late 1990's digital picture editorial was becoming the rage. Andrew rode the **wave of rapidly emerging digital imaging technologies**, as the film industry transitioned from chemical imaging (film) to digital. In addition to being **the "go-to" guy for solving intractable problems** relating to these technologies, Andrew is frequently called upon for visual effects, title design, and research & development for special technical solutions. Some of these projects included **"TRON: Legacy"**, **"Terminator: Salvation"**, **"Beauty and the Beast"** (live action), **"The Fourth Kind"**.

## Members Only
As an actor and voiceover artist, he's a member of the **Screen Actor's Guild**, and is cast most often for his commanding presence. He's a member of the **Editor's Guild** in Hollywood as a film editor and visual effects supervisor, and works on major studio feature films. Also a member of **Academy of Television Arts and Sciences**, and formerly, industry advisor and director of technology for the non-profit **Filmmaker's Alliance**.

### _But the Squirrels Tho_
He writes articles on filmmaking technology, color, imaging, and typography for industry trade publications, and gives seminars and leads discussion groups on film related technologies, with an emphasis on digital filmmaking and post production. He was formerly a columnist for the New York Times' About.com sites, where he wrote a column on civil rights, constitutional law, and civil liberties. His other interests include industrial design, invention, writing, flying, restoring old cars & old appliances, and cats.

## Current Focus
Andrew is conducting research and investigations into human vision, contrast, and color perception—his life-long passion and hyperfocus. He is developing leading edge methods and guidelines for future standards for content designers, aimed toward improving readability of text and providing greater visual accessibility for displays and devices. He is currently Director of Research for [Inclusive Reading Technologies, Inc.][1], a California non-profit.
